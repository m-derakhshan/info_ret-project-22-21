Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) was proposed as a unified evaluation framework to compare the semantic understanding of different NLP systems. in this experiment, we will see some of these techniques and compare their result.At first, we explain some heuristic approaches offered by different people for solving this problem. Then, we extract features of Text and hypothesis to train machine learning models to solve the problem. In the end, we try to achieve better performance by combining different machine learning approaches.
the final model has an accuracy of 88\%, Precision of 84\%, and Recall of 84\%
